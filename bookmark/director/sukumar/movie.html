        <h2 id="1"> 1 Nenokkadine </h2>
        <img width="500px" height="400px" src="../../images/1 nenokkadine.jpg">
        <p> The “One” is a very deep and dark film that is filled with brilliant cinematography, immaculate editing, top notch performances, incredible action and pretty much the best film I have ever seen in tollywood. Right from the beginning I have noticed that the editing was so tense, Its a film that takes its time with its shots. Its a kind of movie in which each and every scene is very meticulously crafted. So many movies now a days are like “just we gotta open with a big fight scene or something showing cockamamie scenes to blow the audience minds and grab their attention”. But NO, the best way to keep audience attentive is subtlety which this movie has, opening with a very quiet scene. </p>
